HOW TO USE IT:
You have 2 text files: itemlist.txt and time.txt
Type your items in itemlist.txt like this:
Hat_name 1.33 ref
Hat_test 1.8 keys
( Name/price/currency (ref/keys) )
Its important not to use spaces in hat names it will cause application crash (i will fix it later xd)
VERY IMPORTANT TO LEAVE FIRST PLACE TO KEY, BECAUSE ECONOMICS ARE DEPENDING ON FIRST ITEM
Then type amount of time (in seconds) in time.txt
Run bot.exe and leave it somewhere at the background
Have fun :^)
