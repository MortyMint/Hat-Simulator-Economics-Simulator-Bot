HOW TO USE IT:
You have 2 text files: itemlist.txt and time.txt
Type your items in itemlist.txt like this:
"Hat Name" 1.33 ref
"Hat Test" 1.8 keys
( Name/price/currency (ref/keys) )
VERY IMPORTANT TO LEAVE FIRST PLACE TO KEY, BECAUSE ECONOMICS ARE DEPENDING ON FIRST ITEM
Then type amount of time (in seconds) in time.txt
Run bot.exe and leave it somewhere at the background (get it from dropbox)
Have fun :^)

Github unique hint: Compile it or get it here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/rl3pl7p749nkarm/HSESB.rar?dl=0 :^)
